🧠 Inspiration  

> “Everyone knows the cost of land. Few know the cost of building on it.”  

Millions of Indian plot owners, especially in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities, delay construction because they don’t know what it will cost to actually build a house. BrickRate gives them the confidence to plan, decide, and start faster.  

🧑‍💻 My Role: *Frontend Developer (Solo)*

📜 Integrated APIs for Maps, Charts, Voice, and PDF.  
🧩 Designed the entire app for **HackVerse presentation demo**.  

🚧 Future Integration (for Full Stack)  

- 🔗 Connect with Java Spring Boot backend for user data and real-time rates.  
- 🧠 Add AI/ML cost prediction microservice (Python Flask).  
- 🏠 3D visualization for home layout vs. cost simulation.
